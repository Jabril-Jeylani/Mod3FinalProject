[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/0fqZI3nZ/mod-3-project)
[Deployed App](https://jabril-jeylani-petshop.onrender.com)
NOTE: Since I've deployed using the free tier of render, it might take up to 30 seconds for the first request to go through. Thank you for your patience. 

## Unsolved Problems ðŸŸ 

User Cart doesn't reset and clear after succcessful purchase.

## Future Enhancements ðŸ”´

I want to implement a full-fledged order screen that asks
for payment details and delivery address.
I also wanted to implement a profile section along with order history and a review section.
